ðŸ’” Dr_Broke is an emotionally intelligent healing agent for Bengali speakersâ€”an ensemble of four AI personas designed to support users through heartbreak, grief, and emotional recovery.

Built with care, cultural context, and psychological insight, Dr_Broke offers a web-based sanctuary where empathy meets AI. Each agent plays a distinct roleâ€”from reflective writing to tough loveâ€”to guide users on their healing journey.
